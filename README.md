# EBHRD
The HR Diagram of Eclipsing Binary Stars

## Background
Big time domain surveys will find [LOTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.6011) of eclipsing binaries.

So... what should we do with them!?


## Question
What is the most valuable Eclipsing Binary?

## Approach
- Compare the observed HR Diagram of known EBs to the total Gaia HR Diagram.
- Where are we currently lacking EBs? (i.e. what masses, phases of stellar evolution, etc)
- How about in short versus long period systems?
